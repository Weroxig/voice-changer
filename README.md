## Overview

This is a fork of [w-okada voice changer](https://github.com/w-okada/voice-changer) that performs real-time voice conversion
using various voice conversion algorithms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This version works only with Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC).

The fork aims to improve the overall performance for any backend, and at the same time introducing new features and improving
user experience.

The following videos demonstrate how the voice changer works and performs with AMD graphics cards (including integrated GPU!):

## Supported operated systems

* Windows 10 or later.
* Linux.
* macOS 12 Monterey or later. With Apple Silicon or Intel CPU.

## System requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Minimum requirement means that you will be able to run **ONLY** the voice changer. Voice conversion and gaming at the same time will not provide satisfying experience with minimum requirements in most cases.

RAM: at least 6GB.

Disk space: at least 6GB of free disk space. For fast model loading, SSD is recommended.

### For CPU-only voice conversion

Minimum requirement: Intel Core i5-4690K or AMD FX-6300.

Recommended requirement: Intel Core i5-10400F or AMD Ryzen 5 1600X.

### For GPU voice conversion

Minimum VRAM required: 2GB (in FP32 mode), ~1GB (in FP16 mode, if supported).

Minimum requirement:

* An integrated graphics card: AMD Radeon Vega 7 (with AMD Ryzen 5 5600G) or later.
* A dedicated graphics card: Nvidia GeForce GTX 900 Series or later, or AMD Radeon RX 400 series or later, or Intel Arc A300 series or later.

> [!NOTE]
> It is also possible to use Nvidia GeForce GTX 700 series GPUs. However, they can be used only with DirectML version.

> [!WARNING]
> The voice changer does not perform well with integrated Intel GPUs. This is a known issue that may be addressed in the future. You may proceed at your own risk and report issues or successful usage.

Recommended requirement:

A dedicated graphics card Nvidia GeForce RTX 20 Series or later, or AMD Radeon RX 6000 series or later, or Intel Arc A500 series or later.

## Known issues

### General

* Mozilla Firefox ESR may not display audio devices.

### DirectML (dml) version

* When changing **Chunk**, **Extra** or **Crossfade size** settings, you must switch device to CPU then back to your GPU.
  Otherwise, performance issues can be observed.

* Only `rmvpe_onnx`, `fcpe_onnx`, `crepe_tiny_onnx` and `crepe_full_onnx` are available in the list of **F0 Det.**.

* When using a laptop with integrated GPU and dedicated GPU, severely degraded performance (up to 50% reduction) can be observed when running the voice changer on built-in display.

* Slightly degraded performance (up to 25% reduction) can be observed with multi-GPU setups.

* AMD Radeon RX 7000 series may be unable to achieve low latency (below 256ms).

### Nvidia version

* When starting voice conversion for the first time, it may take up to 5-7 seconds to start outputting the converted voice.

### All versions

* Only "perf" metric is reported in server audio mode with `rest` protocol.

## How to use

## Troubleshooting

> [!TIP]
> When any issue with the voice changer occurs, check the command line window (the one that opens during the start) for errors.

### Exceptions.PretrainDownloadException: 'Failed to download weight.'

Either the remote files have changed or your files were corrupted. The error will show which files are affected above the error:

```
[WeightDownloader] 'pretrain/content_vec_500.onnx failed to pass hash verification check. Got 1931e237626b80d65ae44cbacd4a5197, expected ab288ca5b540a4a15909a40edf875d1e'
[WeightDownloader] 'pretrain/rmvpe.onnx failed to pass hash verification check. Got 65030149d579a65f15aa7e85769c32f1, expected b6979bf69503f8ec48c135000028a7b0'
```

Find and delete the mentioned files from the voice changer folder and restart the voice changer. Deleted files will be re-downloaded.

### Audio devices are not displayed

1. Make sure that you have given the permission to access the microphone.

1. If you are using Mozilla Firefox ESR, there may be an issue with audio devices. Use other web browser (preferably Chrome or Chromium-based).

### No sound after start

1. Make sure you have selected correct input and output audio devices.

1. Make sure your input device is not muted. Check the microphone volume in the system settings or hardware switch on your headset (usually a button, if present).

1. Try switching input device to **none**, then back to your microphone.

1. If nothing helped, check the command line that opens when your start the app. In case there are any error messages containing `Exception` or `error`, report an issue and provide full text from the command line.

### Hearing non-converted voice

In the voice changer, make sure **passthru** is not on (indicated by blinking red color). Click it to switch it off (indicated by solid green color).

![unpassthru](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/014fd740-d8cb-48f6-8b5c-d53258a34b95)

### Hearing audio crackles

1. Make sure you are using **VAC by Muzychenko** (indicated by the **Line 1** audio device name).

1. In Windows **Sound Control Panel**, make sure that the sample rate of your microphone matches the sample rate of the virtual cable.

   The following example shows the configuration of the virtual cable and the microphone:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd19dcbe-87a8-4e0a-9d3d-baf8015c546c)

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e7ae533-3ba5-4308-895e-54254c2a67e0)

1. If nothing helped, in **Task Manager** > **Details**, try setting the priority for the `audiodg.exe` process to **High**.

### Audio is stuttery

1. If you changed chunk when voice conversion was on, click **Stop** then **Start** again.

1. Make sure the **perf** time is smaller than **Chunk**. Increase **Chunk** or reduce **Extra** and **Crossfade size**.
